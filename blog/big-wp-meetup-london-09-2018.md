Honored to say yesterday I was in London for [Big WP London Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/Big-Media-Enterprise-WordPress-London-Meetup/events/lltfbqyxmbrb/).

I was there to represent Inpsyde, and I presented a session about "WordPress Multisite for large and high traffic multilingual websites".

An abstract:

> Multi-language is not a feature included in WordPress core, and plugin authors have been searching solutions for years.
> This talk compares the most popular approaches to Multi-Language WordPress websites, highlighting the pros of using WP Multisite for the scope, that is the approach used by MultilingualPress, a plugin developed by Inpsyde.

Slides can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/gmazzap/multi-language-wordpress-for-enterprises).

A big thanks to Inpsyde for the opportunity and the organizers for having me.
