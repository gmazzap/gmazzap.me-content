Here the links to the slides of my talk *"Testing WordPress... Without WordPress"* I gave at  [WordCamp Roma 2017](https://2017.rome.wordcamp.org).

The excerpt:

> One of the most known leitmotif for people into code quality assurance is: "run unit tests in isolation". 
> To apply this principle to code written for WordPress will bring us to write tests to be ran without loading WordPress. 
> The talk will mostly pivot on real-world examples of unit-testing WordPress plugins in isolation.
