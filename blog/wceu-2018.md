[**WCEU 2018**](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/) has been a blast, really.

I'm also pretty satisfied with the outcome of the workshop [Thorsten](https://tfrommen.de), [Carl](https://carlalexander.ca/), and me hosted there.

The slides are available [here](https://slides.tfrommen.de/wceu-2018-unit-testing/) (thanks Thorsten) and in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tfrommen/wceu-2018-unit-testing) we used, there's a [branch](https://github.com/tfrommen/wceu-2018-unit-testing/tree/completed) with all the solutions.

A big thank you goes to our two awesome tech assistants [Gary Jones](https://twitter.com/GaryJ) and [Alain Schlesser](https://www.alainschlesser.com/).

A thank you goes also to [Inpsyde](https://inpsyde.com/en/) who supported me to go in Belgrade, and to the *Inpsyders* I met there: Alex, David, Emili, Guido, Jessica, and Robert.
