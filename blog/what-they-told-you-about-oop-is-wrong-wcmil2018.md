# What they told you about OOP is wrong

[Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay)'s invented the term "object oriented" in late 1960's, but the idea he had about that term, is quite different from what people nowadays commonly refer to as "OOP".

The presentation I gave at [WCMIL 2018](https://2018.milano.wordcamp.org/) does a small trip in OOP history to find out why, and advocating a "back to the origin" for a better OOP programming.

Found the slides [here](https://speakerdeck.com/gmazzap/what-they-told-you-about-oop-is-wrong).
