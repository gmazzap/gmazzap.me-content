Here the links to the slides of my talk *"Rock-SOLID Code"* I gave at  [WordCamp Milano 2017](https://2017.milano.wordcamp.org)

The excerpt:

> The SOLID acronym is often used as synonymous of quality OOP code.
> Following the SOLID principles developers can create and maintain code that is strong but flexible to grow and change with minimal difficulty. 
> In this talk the SOLID principles will be explained with the help of basic code samples in the context of WordPress.
