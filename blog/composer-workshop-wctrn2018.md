Here the links to the slides of the 90 minutes workshop *"Composer from Zero to Hero"* I teached at  [WordCamp Torino 2018](https://2018.torino.wordcamp.org/).

The worskshop starts with the very basics concepts of Composer, its not-that-easy integration with WordPress and guides attendances toward the creation of a full WordPress website entirely managed with Composer.

Being a workshop, slides deck won't be really representative of what happened there, anyway it can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/gmazzap/composer-from-zero-to-hero).
