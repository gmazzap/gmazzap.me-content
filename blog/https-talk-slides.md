Yesterday I presented a session about HTTPS at [WP Catania Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/Meetup-WordPress-Catania/).

Because average audience was not technical, I tried to explain without a technical approach, not deep into detail, but I hope enough to understand what HTTPS is, what it does, why it is important.

The original slides (in italian) are [here](https://speakerdeck.com/gmazzap/how-i-learned-to-understand-https-ita).

I translated them in english and they are available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/gmazzap/how-i-learned-to-understand-https).
