I'm happy to announce I will be speaking at [WordCamp Torino 2017](https://2017.torino.wordcamp.org/).

My session will be ["Continuously delivering WordPress"](https://2017.torino.wordcamp.org/session/continuously-delivering-wordpress/) 
and will be in italian.

The english excerpt is something like:

> Once upon a time "web masters" (semi-mythical figures now extinct) to put a website online harmed their self with 
an FTP client and a lot of patience.
>
> Nowadays, things like "DevOps", "Continuous Delivery", "Continuous integration"... are not only "buzzword", but 
practices that any professional developer has to deal with everyday or so.
>
> The talk will expound a series of tools and practices to implement a continuous delivery strategy for modern websites
powered by WordPress.

Shortly after the WordCamp I will post the slides in both italian and english.

See you in Torino?
