Male, italian, thirty-something, geek, atheist, husband and `<?php if( ! $daughter->isBorn() ) : ?>`almost`<?php endif ?>` father.

I gave up with architecture at university after 10 years and 44 passed exams out of 47.

I encountered PHP by mistake at some point in 2005, and I made a bigger mistake in 2006 when I encountered WordPress.

I like to read books about programming languages I'll never use or about universes that will never exist. Believe it or not, I'm a very pragmatic person.

I write thousands of line of code per year. A company named Inpsyde pay for a third of that code, GitHub hosts for free another third and I pay for the hard disk necessary to store the last third (and its backup).
